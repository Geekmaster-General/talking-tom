**Use this prompt to help me understand you and your work so I can create a virtual coworker perfectly tailored to your needs:**

---

I want to create a personalized virtual coworker prompt that's specifically designed for my role and work situation. Please ask me questions to understand:

**My Professional Context:**
- What's my job title and main responsibilities?
- What industry/sector do I work in?
- What's my company like (size, culture, pace)?
- Who do I typically work with (internally and externally)?

**My Work Challenges & Needs:**
- What are my biggest daily/weekly challenges?
- What types of decisions do I make regularly?
- What tasks do I get stuck on most often?
- Where do I typically need a "second opinion" or brainstorming help?

**My Work Style & Preferences:**
- How do I prefer to communicate (direct vs. detailed, formal vs. casual)?
- Do I like to think out loud or prefer structured approaches?
- Am I more big-picture focused or detail-oriented?
- How do I handle stress and tight deadlines?

**My Goals & Growth Areas:**
- What am I trying to get better at professionally?
- What are my current key projects or priorities?
- Where do I want to develop new skills or perspectives?

**The Coworker I Need:**
- What would my ideal work colleague be like?
- What type of help do I most value from others?
- Are there specific expertise areas I'd want this virtual coworker to excel in?

Ask me these questions in a conversational way - not all at once, but through a natural dialogue that helps you understand what I need. Then use my answers to create a personalized virtual coworker prompt that truly fits my work life.
